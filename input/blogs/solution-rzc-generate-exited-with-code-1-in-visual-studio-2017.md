I just got this error while publishing my first ASP.NET Core application in Self-Contained Deployment mode.

## Solution
One liner solution to this problem is - **Just repair your Visual Studio**.

Though I took some screenshots of repairing steps, I thought attaching those screenshots here might help you.

1. **Step 1:** Search for Visual Studio Installer.
