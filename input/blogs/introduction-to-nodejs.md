**What is NodeJS?**

NodeJS is a server-side JavaScript programming language. You can think of it as C#. As C#'s code get executed on server, in the same way NodeJS's code is also executed on Node server. You can not write NodeJS (server-side JavaScript) that will execute on browser.

**What is NPM?**

NPM is a code library or you can say a repository for NodeJS. It contains thousands of packages which we can install and use in our Node application. If you are a .NET Developer, then you can think of it as Nuget Package Manager.

**Usage of Node**

*   You can create a Node server that will listen for the requests and
   provide response to them.

*   You can create a web application that will return HTML pages using
   Node.

*   You can build API in node that will use MongoDB or any NoSQL database
   as back-end.

*   Node is very much lightweight server which can handle many concurrent
   requests at a time.

*   You can build highly consumable application by using combination of
   NodeJS & NoSQL database.
