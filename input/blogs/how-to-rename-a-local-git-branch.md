If you want to rename the branch you are currently working on, hit below command:

`git branch -m <newBranchName>`

If the branch you want to rename is different from your current branch, then hit below command

`git branch -m <oldBranchName> <newBranchName>`

To check your **current branch**, hit below command. You can see the current branch highlighted followed by an asterisk.

`git branch`
