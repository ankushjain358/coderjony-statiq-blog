If you are preparing for Amazon interviews, then you must prepare yourself for the behavioral or leadership round of interviews at Amazon.

In the leadership round of interviews, you will be asked scenario-based questions that you can not answer instantly without any early preparation. So, in my opinion, it is better to go through each of these questions and think about an incident that has happened to you in the past, and how can use that incident to answer a question.

ðŸ‘‰ Be honest. If you are speaking the truth in your answers, you will be more confident during the interview.
