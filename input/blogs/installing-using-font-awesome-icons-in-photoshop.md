In this post, we will understand how can we use font-awesome icons in Photoshop. Font-awesome is a font library that contains hundreds of useful & latest icons in form of fonts. We can use these icons in our Photoshop design by following these easy steps. So let's just start:

**Step 1:** Visit [Download](https://fontawesome.com/download) page of Font Awesome library from this link - [https://fontawesome.com/download](https://fontawesome.com/download) & click on **Free for Desktop** button to download free fonts for your computer.

**Step 11:** **Important:** Sometimes, you may find that even after selecting the font-awesome font, the text is not converting into an icon. For this issue, you may try switching the two more available options **Regular** and **Solid**. This should fix your issue.
