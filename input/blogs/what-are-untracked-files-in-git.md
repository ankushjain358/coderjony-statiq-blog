Whenever `Git` finds a new file inside the application folder, it is considered an **Untracked File** by `Git`, because `Git` doesn't know the file until we explicitly tell it about that file. 

So, to let `Git` know about the file, we `stage` the file and `commit` or `push` it into the repository and make it a tracked file.

These Untracked Files are generated in two ways:

1. **Manually** - By by adding new files to the application. i.e. __To create new HTML page, Class file, SQL file etc.__
2. **Automatic** - These files may also be generated by some process in the application. For example, whenever we do the following things. 
    - **Build a .NET application** - Files generated in `bin` and `obj` folders are untracked files.
    - **Install node modules** - Files generated in `node_modules`folder are untracked files.
