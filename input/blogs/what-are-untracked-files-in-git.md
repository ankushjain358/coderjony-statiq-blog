Whenever `Git` finds a new file inside the application folder, it is considered an **Untracked File** by `Git`, because `Git` doesn't know the file until we explicitly tell it about that file. 

So, to let the `Git` know about the file, we `stage` the file and `commit` / `push` it into the repository and make it a tracked file.

These Untracked Files can be either generated in two ways:

1.  

**Manually**: By adding new files in the application. i.e. To create new HTML page, Class file, SQL file etc.

2.  

**Automatic**: These files may also be generated by some process in the application. For example, whenever we do the following things. 

    *   **Build a .NET application** - Files generated in `bin` and `obj` folders are untracked files.

    *   **Install node modules** - Files generated in `node_modules`folder are untracked files.

    *   etc.
